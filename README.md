# ModelUSGov Legislation Archive

This is a website created to serve as a permanent archive of legislation from the [ModelUSGov](//reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov) subreddits. It has a fully-functional RESTful API, a user authentication system, an administrator panel and a responsive design.

This site is currently in beta, but you can view the [live demo](//keelan.pythonanywhere.com).

### Using this yourself

Please feel free to fork this repo and adapt or customise it for your needs. I'd be more than happy to help you with the installation. If you're doing a similar thing to ModelUSGov on Reddit, [just drop me a message](//www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=KeelanD) and I'll help with rebranding the site.

### API

On the live demo you can see a [guide to the API](//keelan.pythonanywhere.com/api/). I'm currently working on a full documentation. The API on the demo site is fully-functional, though, so you can check it out.

The API was built from scratch, because it needed to be more versatile than the Django REST framework. For this reason, it might be difficult to repurpose.
